# LIRI-Node-App

##### Homework Assignment 10 - Node.js

LIRI is somewhat akin to SIRI; however, while SIRI is a "Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface", LIRI is a "Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface".  LIRI is a command line node application that is used to provide you with data given certain parameters and requests.  I made the first version of this app according the specifications provided in the instructions, and then chose to make a second version of this app for two different reasons: 1.) I wished to experiment with using inquirer to make the app and explore the options available with it, and 2.) because I wanted to expand upon the idea of allowing LIRI to chose what to display.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to install and run LIRI you will need Node.js as well as Spotify API keys which you will provide through your own .env file.  Links to both Node.js and Spotify can be found below.

```
node.js
Spotify API Keys
```

### Installing

You will need to do the following steps after cloning the repo to your device in order to ensure that it works properly.

To ensure Node.js is running within the package and configure all modules for use:

```
npm install
```

This should install all the requisite modules, but just in case, these are the ones necessary:

```
dotenv
inquirer
moment
node-spotify-api
request
```

Then create your own .env file in which to store your Spotify Keys, the file should look just like this:

```
SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret
```

## Running LIRI

LIRI is run from the command line via:

```
node liri.js
```

And is able to accept the following commands:

```
concert-this <artist/band name here>
```

In doing so, LIRI will query BandsinTown for upcoming concerts by the artist and display the venue, location, and date of the performance.

```
spotify-this-song <song name here>
```

This prompts LIRI to query the Spotify API for the song name, where it will then display the artist, song name, preview link (if available), and the album for the song.  I chose to change the search functions for this so that it would return 5 songs instead of just one, in order to ensure the proper one was actually returned, and not just another of the same name (for those searching for alternative/obscure artists).

```
movie-this <movie title here>
```

This will query the OMDB API for the movie title, year of release, ratings, country, language, plot, and actors in the movie.  (If no movie is entered, it will display the information for 'Mr. Nobody").

```
do-what-it-says
```

This will cause LIRI to read from the 'random.txt' file included in the repo and then she will perform one of the commands based on the data included in that file.  I added to this so that LIRI would be able to read from different formats, and so that you were not constrained to the one particular format for the entry in 'random.txt'.  I now have it reading from an array of available options so that it knows which API to specify, arrays that can be expanded to include other various keywords, and yet LIRI will still know what exactly 'random.txt' is telling it to query.

Additionally, the search parameters, along with the corresponding data returned from the APIs is written to the 'log.txt' file.  To keep a record of the past search queries and data returned.

* [Screenshot - Do What it Says - Log](screenshots/youpick-log-screenshot.png)

(I chose to leave in some of the portions of commented-out code in the functions that would log the data to the console.  This was the original method for printing the data to the console, however I chose to simply log the object due to the fact that color difference allowed the data to be easier to read.)
